# Neural-Canvas
NeuralCanvas ðŸŽ¨
Transform Your Photos into Stunning Artwork with Neural Style Transfer!
Overview
NeuralCanvas implements Neural Style Transfer (NST) to combine the content of one image with the style of another. This project is part of my CodTech internship, where the goal is to demonstrate NST in action using deep learning techniques.

Features
Transform any content image into a stunning artwork inspired by a style image.

Powered by the pretrained VGG19 model.

Customizable settings for content and style weights.

Outputs high-quality stylized images.

Getting Started
Requirements
Python 3.7+

Required libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
Steps
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/sony928/NeuralCanvas.git
cd NeuralCanvas
Add your content and style images to the project folder.

Update the file paths in the script or notebook:

python
Copy
Edit
content_path = "path/to/your/content.jpg"
style_path = "path/to/your/style.jpg"
Run the notebook or Python script to generate your styled image.

Output Examples
Content Image	Style Image	Stylized Image

Technologies Used
Python

TensorFlow & Keras

Pretrained VGG19 Model

NumPy & Matplotlib
