NeuralCanvas üé®
Transform your photos into stunning artwork with Neural Style Transfer!
Project Overview
NeuralCanvas is a Python-based project that implements Neural Style Transfer (NST), a deep learning technique that blends the content of one image with the style of another. With this repository, you can create mesmerizing images where your content photo is painted in the artistic style of another image.

Features
Combines the content of one image with the artistic style of another.

Uses the pretrained VGG19 model for feature extraction.

Customizable parameters for content and style weights.

Generates high-quality styled images.

How It Works
The content image provides the structure and layout.

The style image defines the artistic patterns and colors.

A deep learning model processes both images to create a stylized output image.

Technologies Used
Python

TensorFlow and Keras

Pretrained VGG19 model

NumPy and Matplotlib

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Install Python (version >= 3.7).

Install required libraries using:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/sony928/NeuralCanvas.git
cd NeuralCanvas
Add your images to the folder (e.g., content.jpg and style.jpg).

Update the file paths in the script:

python
Copy
Edit
content_path = "path/to/your/content.jpg"
style_path = "path/to/your/style.jpg"
Run the notebook or Python script to generate your styled image.

Output Example
